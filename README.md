## Overview

### The challenge


- The form validation should be done using pure JavaScript.
- When clicking to submit the form, if any field is not filled out, the input border should turn red and a "campo obrigat√≥rio" message should appear below the unfilled field, according to the Figma design.
- The background of the form should be created using the image attached in the lesson.
